# go-pipelines

This repository contains a batch image management server.

To make the server process the image as fast and efficient as possible, 
a few different types of processing were introduced: _sequential_, _concurrent_ and _different pipeline processing_.
Take a look at `cmd/go-pipelines/main.go`

A package which provides a framework to implement pipeline processing is here: [github.com/ele7ija/pipeline](https://github.com/ele7ija/pipeline).

The project isn't deployed anywhere, but it is dead easy to run it on your local machine, take a look at links below.
